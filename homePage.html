<h1> <center>Pikiaboy's Learning Road</h1> </center>

<p id="paragraph">All-righty then. I've been meaning to do something
like this for a while now but I never got around to doing it.Essentially, this
is going to be everything CS related that I learn throughout school and what
not. I want to be able to keept it up to date as much as possible, but most
likely, I won't be able to do that. If you're reading this right now, you're
going to get the barbones of what limited knowledge I have so far. I most
likely will be leaving this page as it is and figure out what I want to do with
it later on. Bare with me, as my HTML and CSS knowledge are <b>VERY</b> limited.
But lets get to how much I suck later on.
</p>

<p id="paragraph">As of writing this, I have some knowledge in Java
  and C++. I have gone through the entire Java sequence at De Anza college and
  am currently taking Data Structures in C++. I plan to add links to my projects
  and my homework assignements and what I learned from them sometime in the
  future on this page. Maybe add them inline inside the HTML file? Kind of like
  linking my <a href="https://github.com/pikiaboy"> github</a> to this page,
  or something along the sorts of that. I might clean this page up later,
  but I kind of like the idea of having something improve over time and I can
  see how bad it is when I first started. But I guess thats what github is for
  right?
